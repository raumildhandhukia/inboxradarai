        <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
        as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, InboxRadarAI) are called
        &quot;first party cookies.&quot; Cookies set by parties other than the
        website owner are called &quot;third party cookies.&quot; Third party
        cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on
        or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
        analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize
        your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
        it visits certain other websites.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some
        cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our websites and
        services to operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential or
        &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us to
        track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
        our platforms. Third parties serve cookies through our websites for
        advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
        Services and their purposes include:
